# Java-project
A Java Mobile Application (that hasn't been tested to work on mobile) that allows you to track your monthly spending.
Made as a course final project.
# Features
- A simple UI fully written in Java. Use Android studio was prohibited, so I had to deal with it
- Add/Edit/Delete your Incomes and Expenses!
- Automatic generation of expense/income labels!
- An image uploader to store your receipts or any image! Its dates and values too!
- high chance of inefficient code! (it doesn't crash, its just terrible code)
# Screenshots
- 1: main screen.
- 2,3: view and edit expenses screen.
- 4,5: receipt gallery and an empty month.
